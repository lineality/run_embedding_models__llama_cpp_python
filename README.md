Embedding Models are a varity of model, in some sense more old fashioned, where the goal is not to generate a higher-level end product, but merely to output the matrix vector of the input.

And though this may seem like only half a model, this is an
extremely powerful form of model and tool.

Fortunately, though much more attention is paid to chat-bot oriented contexts, tools are available to make use of gguf formats of embedding models highly practical.

See the included .ipynb python-notebook files.

Code should be able to run either in colab or run locally, and be adapted to production code outside of a notebook.
